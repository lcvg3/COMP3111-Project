**Question: What is the difference between data filtering and data transformation? Do we need to pick one from each?**

`act2` `feature5`

*Data filtering* is the task of reducing the content of noise or errors from measured process data. *Data transformation* is the process of converting data or information from one format to another. In feature 5, the first 2 operations are data filtering techniques and the last 2 operations are data transformation techniques.

 **TWO types** of Data Filtering and Transformation from the table refer to:

 - Implement 1 filtering and 1 transformation OR
 - Implement 2 filtering technqiues OR
 - Implement 2 transformation techniques

**Question: How many comparison operators in feature 5 - Filtering numeric data?**

`act2` `feature 5`

Comparison operators are (>, >=, ==, <=, <, !=). However, if you implement one, the rest is very easy to implement. We expect teams to implement all of the above comparison operators.

**Question: What to submit for the workload distribution in activity 1?**

`act1`

It is just a simple table indicating how the features are assigned. In the Google Spreadsheet, I observe that not every group makes the feature assignment yet. We should finalise it in Activity 1. Once it is set in the activity 1, no further changes are allowed.

**Question: Why implementation classes are included in the UML Lab?**

`act1` `uml` `lab4`

The UML lab is designed to help students **learn the skills and tools to draw UML diagrams**, but not the correctness of the UML diagrams. Given the problem domain, the correctness and appropriateness of drawing UML diagrams was thoroughly discussed in the lecture. In other words, please **don't regard the UML lab result as the sample solution** of the Activity 1.

**Question: What things and How to submit Activity 1/2?**

`act1` `act2`

The submission details and deadlines can be found in Canvas. In short:
- **each student** needs to submit a **PDF** in **Activity 1**, and 
- **each team**, *represented by the team leader*, needs to submit a **private GithHub** URL in **Activity 2**

**Question: Any format for meeting minutes and Gantt chart?**

`act1` `minutes` `Gantt chart`

- **Meeting minutes:** A [template](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp3111/Project/resources/minutes-template.docx) is provided
- **Gantt chart:** It is flexible to use any tool (e.g. Excel, other online tools, ...) to draw a Gantt chart, which is just a variation of bar chart. Suggestion: x-axis (date), y-axis (tasks/sub-tasks), bars with 3 different colors representing 3 different team members 

---
**Question: About Animated Chart.**

Should we use one of the two decided charts and make it into an animation? Or should we put animated chart as a separate generalization for a chart class?

`act2` `feature 6`

There is no restriction. Teams can decide to implement multiple separated chart classes, or a generalized chart class with multiple subclasses, or an animate method in a chart. 

---
**Question: About Data Filtering and Transformation** 

Do we only need to implement 2 out of the given 4 algorithms?

`act2` `feature 5`

Yes. Select any 2 out of the 4 algorithms in the table.

**Question: GitHub education account**

GitHub rejects our application due to the reason that it cannot verify our academic status. How to solve it?

`github` `git`

You may use a personal email account to create a GitHub account. Check the following items:
- Visit the "GitHub email settings page" and add your ITSC email
- You are expected to receive a verification email. Please click verify in that email.
- After that, you can go back to GitHub Education and re-apply.

**Question: Attribute visibility**

For the COMP3111 Project activity 1(UML diagram), do we have to show the visibility for each attributes (i.e. +, #, - next to the attributes of classes)?

`act1` `uml` `class diagram`

Class attributes and operations should be included. Example in slide 15-16, UML Modeling 1 lecture

---
**Question: Assignment 1 submission detail**

Does it mean that UML class diagram(and use-case) for each member has to be different or all the members are expected to submit the same work?

`act1` `uml` `use case diagram` `class diagram`

The UML class/use-case diagram can be the same, or can be different. It won't count as plagiarism as the diagrams are agreed by the whole team. In any case, assignment 1 is an individual assessment.
